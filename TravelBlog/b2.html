        The beauty of Havelock Island in Andaman kept me engrossed on my 10-day trip to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. The moment I landed at Port Blair, I didn't know what to expect from Andaman Islands, I was on an impromptu, unplanned trip. All I knew was I wanted to dive and get certified as an Advanced Adventure SCUBA Diver in Andaman Islands. I had heard a lot about Andaman sea hiding many marine gems in its vast expanse. I knew the diving was good around Havelock Island and so I headed there the very next morning. I planned to dive to my heart's content in Havelock and then hop around different islands in Andaman. It's only after I stayed there for few days I realized how irresistible everything about this island is. "Unlike me", I didn't hop around to any other Island but spent all my days at Havelock.
        I could just not keep my eyes away from the myriad shades of blue. I would keep gazing through the clear waters, the sky, the meadows, the crystal sand.
