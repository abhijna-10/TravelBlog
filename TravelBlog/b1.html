    <p>
      Bondi Beach is one of Australia’s most famous beaches, known for its golden sands and surfing culture.
      Visitors can enjoy scenic coastal walks, vibrant cafés, and lively events year-round.
      Bondi Beach was a working-class suburb throughout most of the twentieth century with migrant people from New Zealand comprising the majority of the local population. Following World War II, Bondi Beach, and the Eastern Suburbs became home to Jewish migrants from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. A stream of Jewish immigration continued into the 21st century and the area has some synagogues and a kosher butcher
